The purpose of this web-site is to tell a little bit about me : who I am, my projects, what have I donne, my skills and my professional contact. 

This was **my very fisrt Github repo** and also my very fisrt piece of code I have ever publicly shown  ! 

It was build on July 2019 with HTML, CSS and Javascript. Graphic design was build with Adobe Illustrator and In Design inspired by the 80's TV color MIR.
